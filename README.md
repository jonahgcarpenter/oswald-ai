# Oswald AI - Uncensored Digital Servant

> Fully local, fully uncensored, with no paid API required.

## Overview

Oswald AI is a local-first, self-hosted assistant that brings your chosen language model to iMessage, Discord, and Home Assistant.
It combines tools, private long-term memory, conversation continuity, image understanding, and connected services into one assistant that follows you across linked accounts while keeping you in control of your data.

## Features

- Chat through iMessage, Discord, or the [Home Assistant integration](https://github.com/jonahgcarpenter/has-oswald-conversation)
- Send text, images, animated GIFs, and replies with quoted context
- Search the web, check the current time, and use connected MCP tools
- Remember your preferences, projects, and other useful details across conversations
- Keep continuity in long conversations and search earlier conversation details
- Link your accounts so your personal memory follows you across gateways
- List or forget your stored personal memories

## Memory

Oswald uses four memory layers:

- **Soul:** Operator-managed personality and policy loaded from `data/memory/soul/soul.md`.
- **Global memory:** Administrator-curated facts about Oswald that the model searches when relevant.
- **Personal memory:** Private preferences, projects, relationships, and other durable facts shared across your linked accounts.
- **Conversation memory:** Recent exchanges and summaries that preserve continuity within the current conversation.

Personal memories are formed in the background after a response is delivered. Oswald prioritizes clear first-person facts, tracks confidence and provenance, and labels uncertain inferences accordingly.

Use `/reset` to start a new conversation without deleting personal memory. Use `/memories` to list or forget personal memories. Administrators manage shared facts with the `/global-memory` commands.

## Usage

### Discord/iMessage Bot

In DMs or direct chats, send any message:

```text
What is the current weather?
```

In server channels or group chats, mention Oswald:

```text
@Oswald What is the capital of France?
```

You can also reply to a message and mention Oswald to include that message as context:

```text
[Replying to Jonah: "The capital of the US is New York"]
@Oswald Is this true?
```

Replies to Oswald do not need another mention:

```text
[Reply to Oswald's message]
Can you elaborate on that?
```

## Web Search

Web search is optional. Configure `BRAVE_API_KEY`, `SEARXNG_URL`, both, or neither:

| Configuration | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Brave only | Use Brave's metered Search-plan LLM Context API. |
| SearXNG only | Use the configured self-hosted SearXNG instance. |
| Both | Use Brave first and fall back to SearXNG when Brave fails or has no usable result. |
| Neither | Start normally without advertising `web.search` to the model. |

Brave requires an activated Search plan and billing information. Its pricing, monthly credits, query retention, and terms can change; consult Brave's current API documentation before enabling it. Oswald sends concise search queries to Brave and retains bounded successful tool-call history with the active conversation. SearXNG remains the no-paid-API alternative, and its engine selection and weighting stay deployment-owned.

## Bootstrap

When no administrator exists, Oswald prints a process-local, single-use bootstrap code to the terminal. From an authenticated Discord, iMessage, or Home Assistant conversation, run:

```text
/bootstrap <code>
```

The account that submits the code becomes the first administrator. The code is consumed only after the account update succeeds. If the code is lost, restart Oswald to generate a replacement while no administrator exists. Once any administrator exists, startup no longer generates bootstrap codes.

## Commands

Commands are gateway-level slash commands. They are handled before requests reach the model.

In Discord servers and iMessage groups, slash commands must mention Oswald
