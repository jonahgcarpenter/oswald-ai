# AGENTS.md - Oswald AI Developer Reference

This is the implementation and contributor reference for the current codebase. `README.md` describes the product and user commands. `.env.example` is the canonical application environment-variable inventory; sample values are not necessarily runtime defaults. Source code, permanent migrations, and tests define behavior when documentation disagrees.

Keep this document current when changing architecture, authorization, persistence, provider contracts, or operational limits. Describe implemented behavior, not planned features. Preserve documentation of compatibility paths that still read persisted data; do not maintain a history of removed features here.

## Project And Verification

Oswald is a Go application with one iterative LLM-backed agent, exposed through Discord, iMessage/BlueBubbles, and an optional Home Assistant WebSocket gateway. Discord and iMessage accept current-turn images and supported document uploads; Home Assistant accepts text only but can query the user's document library. There is no JavaScript, TypeScript, or frontend application in this repository.

The module declares Go 1.25.7. SQLite, sqlite-vec, and image decoding include native/CGO dependencies. Use a working C/C++ toolchain, CGO, and the `sqlite_fts5` build tag. Discord GIFV extraction additionally uses `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`.

```bash
go run -tags sqlite_fts5 ./cmd/agent/main.go
go build -tags sqlite_fts5 ./...
go test -tags sqlite_fts5 ./...
go test -race -tags sqlite_fts5 ./...
go vet -tags sqlite_fts5 ./...
gofmt -w .
git diff --check
```

Run focused tests while editing and the full suite for cross-package changes. Use `-count=1` when an uncached run is needed. A different installed Go toolchain can be overridden per command with `GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.25.7`. Do not run the real application to test a refactor against local credentials or the production database.

The checked-in release workflow, `.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`, runs tagged tests before building and publishing the container on published releases. It does not currently enforce race, vet, or formatting checks on every PR; run those locally when appropriate.

## Directory Ownership

Use shallow domain grouping. Separate files by responsibility within a package before creating new packages. Subpackages are justified by distinct ownership or dependency direction, not by an arbitrary line-count limit.

### Dependency Rules

- `internal/startup` is the composition root. It imports domain packages; domain packages must not import it. `main` should not assemble stores, workers, tools, or gateways.
- Shared account functionality belongs in `accounts`, not `commands/accountlinking`. User/global-memory storage belongs in `memory`, not builtin tool handlers. Commands and tools adapt their respective entry points to those services.
- Keep transaction-fenced candidate publication, job/outbox changes, account merges, and deletion together. Do not turn an atomic operation into independent service commits to achieve a directory split.
- Worker packages depend on stores, never the reverse. `memory` must not import `documents`, `memory/formation`, or `memory/indexing`; `database` must not import `database/maintenance`. Document persistence belongs in `memory/user_document*.go`; `documents/service.go` runs extraction jobs, and command/tool adapters use the store.
- Token-budget policy belongs under `compaction/budget`. The agent assembles prompts using that policy; `llm` owns wire token fields and provider usage telemetry. Budget estimators depend on LLM types, so the LLM client must not import the budget package back.
- Concrete gateways are composed by `gateway/bootstrap.go`. They use `gateway/routing` and `gateway/runtime` without importing the parent composition package. Neither `main` nor `startup` should import concrete gateways directly.
- `shared` is not a utility facade. Import `shared/requestctx`, `shared/lease`, or `shared/invalidation` directly. Do not add a generic `utils`, `common`, or forwarding package for unrelated functions.
- `tools/names` stays dependency-free. The builtin registry and MCP provider remain separate; the agent combines them into an advertised request catalog. Do not make builtin handlers import the parent `tools` composition package.
- Web and ComfyUI clients are currently tool-specific implementations under `tools/builtin`. Move functionality into a domain package when it has shared ownership, not simply because it is reusable in theory.
- `memory/memorytest` is test support, never a production dependency. Same-package memory tests use private local fixtures to avoid importing their parent through the test-support package.

### File And API Names

- Prefer responsibility-based files: `session_delivery.go`, `candidate_store.go`, `account_merge.go`, `replies.go`. Avoid dumping unrelated behavior into `store.go`, `types.go`, or `helpers.go`.
- `agent/agent.go` owns the main loop. Its context, compaction coordination, streaming, tools, tool history, and image retries are separate files in the same package; do not fragment the state machine into unnecessary services.
- `accounts/service.go` owns construction/lifecycle; `identity.go`, `moderation.go`, `identifiers.go`, and `challenges.go` own their named responsibilities.
- `llm/types.go` contains provider-neutral contracts; `llm/gateway_wire.go` contains private wire representations.
- `memory/formation_jobs.go` persists work; `memory/formation` runs it. Likewise, `memory/compaction_jobs.go` persists compaction jobs while `compaction` plans and executes them.
- Names must distinguish pending versus delivered, staging versus publication, paging versus complete results, and deactivation/retirement versus deletion. Keep `Tx` suffixes where callers supply the transaction.
- Prefer a named input struct for a multi-field write, as in `AppendPendingSessionTurn(ctx, memory.SessionTurnWrite{...})`, rather than an expanding positional API or feature suffix chain.
- Use descriptive test and fixture names, not issue numbers or retired production API names. Release/version names remain appropriate for actual migration and artifact compatibility tests.

## Code Style And Change Discipline

These are requirements for new and changed code, not guarantees that every existing implementation conforms.

- Use `gofmt`. Group imports as standard library, third-party, then internal; use aliases only when they disambiguate package names or prevent shadowing.
- Prefer the smallest correct change. Keep cohesive code in one function/package unless extraction improves a real boundary or removes meaningful duplication. Do not add repository/service/interface layers merely for symmetry.
- Add doc comments to exported APIs. Comments should explain invariants, ownership, units, or non-obvious decisions, not restate assignments. Keep error paths and state transitions explicit.
- Use `context.Context` as the first argument to cancelable work and propagate cancellation. Detached contexts are reserved for deliberately independent worker lifetimes and bounded cleanup/durable bookkeeping; document why they are needed.
- Wrap errors with `%w` when the caller must retain the cause. Use typed/sentinel errors and `errors.Is`/`errors.As` for behavioral decisions rather than matching human-readable text.
- Only `main` calls `Fatal` or exits the process. Domain and startup APIs return errors after required cleanup. Report recoverable degradation with structured warnings; do not panic for routine runtime failures.
- Make transaction and lock ownership clear. Defer rollback, close rows/resources, check iteration errors, and keep tenant/source/lease predicates in the transaction that performs a mutation.
- Keep persisted units explicit: UTF-8 bytes, runes, tokens, durations, and row-selection bounds are not interchangeable. Do not truncate inside a UTF-8 sequence or split a conversation exchange to fit a prompt.
- Preserve model-visible names, JSON fields, error codes, log event/metric keys, commands, routes, environment variables, and persisted artifact formats during internal renames. Exported Go-field renames may change implicit JSON; inspect serialization before renaming.
- Do not add backward-compatibility aliases without a concrete persisted-data or external-consumer requirement. Do not delete active compatibility decoders just because new work uses another format.
- Keep unrelated user changes intact. Never commit credentials, local databases, generated media, or real transcript fixtures. Update `.env.example` with actual configuration changes and this file with contract changes.

## Test Contract

Tests must run without project secrets or live LLM, Discord, BlueBubbles, MCP, Brave, SearXNG, ComfyUI, or embedding services.

- Use fake model clients/transports, `httptest` servers, temporary files/databases, injected clocks, and explicit synthetic principals and credentials.
- Use `memory/memorytest` for external-package memory fixtures. Keep generation fencing and explicit pending-to-delivered transitions; do not introduce parallel SQL writers to bypass production publication. Direct SQL fixtures are appropriate for deliberate migration/corruption/invariant tests.
- Keep helpers in `_test.go` unless shared test packages require otherwise. Production code must not import test helpers or expose compatibility APIs solely to preserve old fixtures.
- Prefer channels over sleeps for lifecycle tests. Join fake goroutines, close stores, restore environment changes, and keep concurrent log captures synchronized.
- Configuration tests must not depend on a developer's `.env` or inherited secrets. Avoid printing complete config structs in failure messages.
- Startup tests use private per-call database-path, registry, and gateway seams. Do not start real listeners to test `startup.Run`.
- Test both callback-present and callback-absent model calls, pending/failed/delivered turns, stale leases, account-merge fences, fallback retrieval, and disabled tools when changing those paths.
- Retain failure and rollback coverage during refactors. Passing compilation alone does not establish SQL, wire, delivery, or authorization equivalence.

## Startup And Shutdown

`cmd/agent/main.go` loads config, calls the terminal-gated banner, creates the logger, registers interrupt/SIGTERM handling, and calls `startup.Run(ctx, cfg, log, stdout)`. It releases signal registration before final fatal logging.

`startup/app.go` validates required model settings and assembles components in this order:

1. LLM client, context budget, and soul loader.
2. User-memory, global-memory, MCP, and account database handles; MCP manager and account service.
3. Bootstrap command service; a process-local code and printed instructions are created only when no administrator exists.
4. Indexing, immediate-then-periodic maintenance, and local document extraction workers.
5. Builtin registry, MCP provider, private memory extractor, formation service, and shared compactor/compaction service.
6. Agent, then broker workers, command service, invalidation bus, and enabled gateways.
7. Formation/compaction low-priority gates and worker starts, then gateway goroutines.

Cleanup is registered as resources are acquired and runs on both ordinary shutdown and partial initialization failure. The order is **maintenance, broker, documents, formation, compaction, indexing, MCP clients, accounts DB, MCP DB, global-memory DB, user-memory DB**. It is intentionally not reverse acquisition order.

The local document extraction worker starts alongside maintenance with an independent lifetime and no broker model permit. It claims queued or expired-lease jobs sequentially, polling every two seconds when idle. Extraction is bounded to three minutes within a five-minute lease; publication renews synchronously and uses the exact rotated token. Shutdown cancels and joins extraction/subprocess cleanup before database closure, leaving interrupted jobs reclaimable after lease expiry. Storage conversion assigns zero-based ordinals and splits UTF-8 text into at most 1,024 chunks of 16 KiB each, with text plus locator/method metadata capped at 1 MiB. Budget omissions are partial; useful resource-limit results may publish partial, other extraction errors fail with fixed safe codes, and empty extraction fails as `no_extractable_text`. Startup logs capability booleans at INFO and warns without disabling chat when local binaries are unavailable. `documents.job.complete` measures each attempt with a fresh operation ID, canonical user, `document_extraction` workload, committed chunk/byte counts, and outcome, without payloads. Maintenance reports committed expiry deletions as `user_document_deleted_count` in its existing summary and row-operation total.

- Startup returns `startup.Error` with the original event, message, and cause only after cleanup. MCP close failures are warnings; database close errors are discarded here and do not replace initialization errors.
- Startup logs build metadata and initialization/cleanup phase boundaries. `app.shutdown.complete` follows every acquired resource's cleanup callback, including partial initialization failure, and reports cleanup duration and reason. It does not establish a gateway-stop/readiness contract.
- Signal cancellation triggers cleanup; it is not the parent of every worker context. Worker `Stop` methods must complete before their databases close.
- Before ordinary cleanup, startup calls the optional `StopOutbound` gateway hook. Discord cancels delivery waiters and joins its outbound worker before broker command drain. This is not a websocket/listener shutdown or a join of all runtime acknowledgement bookkeeping.
- Pre-cancellation and explicit initialization-boundary checks return normally. Cancellation does not interrupt every initializer or override every simultaneous initialization error.
- Gateway `Start` failures are logged asynchronously. There is no readiness handshake or graceful gateway-stop interface. Real listeners may outlive `Run` until process exit; it is not a restartable in-process application API.
- `startup/banner.go` prints the fixed UTF-8 wordmark and URL in bright-magenta ANSI only to terminal stdout. Banner failures are ignored; the banner is not readiness.
- `startup/bootstrap.go` prints nonempty bootstrap instructions to the supplied writer even without a terminal. Codes are never structured-log fields. Claiming from authenticated Discord, iMessage, or Home Assistant is supported.

## Requests, Routing, And Accounts

Gateways normalize messages, attachments, replies, external identities, and conversation scope. `accounts` resolves canonical ownership; `identity.Principal` carries canonical user, external identity, gateway, and assurance. `shared/requestctx` propagates that principal, correlation metadata, current images, exposure state, and bounded foreground-memory staging.

`gateway/routing.Decide` chooses ignore, command, model submission, or direct fallback. `gateway/runtime.Execute` handles the admitted operation and gateway-specific responder.

- Private conversations do not require mentions. Ordinary group messages require a mention or a recognized reply to Oswald. Group slash-command attempts require a mention even when replying to Oswald.
- Command handlers do not receive private/group scope. `/connect`, `/bootstrap`, and other admitted authenticated commands can run in groups; codes and responses may be visible there.
- Reply enrichment can include quoted text, replied-to images within remaining slots, unsupported labels, or unavailable-message markers. Incomplete Discord references or uncached iMessage replies can be ignored during preflight before later lookup occurs; invocation through every incomplete reply is not guaranteed.
- Shared routing checks for empty assembled input, including reply and unsupported-file notes; a current document loader admits document-only model requests without inventing authored text. Home Assistant rejects blank text earlier; iMessage ignores payloads without text or attachments.
- Runtime requires authentication and checks bans before admitted commands/model work. Ignore and direct empty-fallback paths return earlier. A ban is not a universal execution-time recheck or cancellation of already-admitted work.
- The command dispatcher validates principals but does not enforce `AdminOnly` metadata by itself. Builtin assembly installs admin middleware; `/mcp global` and `/stop all` check authorization explicitly.
- Admin authorization re-resolves the external account. Account mutations and memory commands have additional ownership/fencing rules; do not assume every handler refreshes ownership identically. `/reset` and user MCP commands use the carried canonical ID.

### Broker And Command Scheduling

`broker` schedules normal operations in FIFO lanes keyed by canonical user and session. Only the lane head occupies a worker. The outstanding-work limit is ten plus the effective worker count, including active and queued scheduled work; nonpositive worker configuration becomes one. Agent saturation produces a fallback, while scheduled commands can be rejected with an error response rather than blocking indefinitely.

- User-exclusive command fences protect account-wide operations. Connect confirmation can fence both participants; delete-user fences its target. Fences remain held through response delivery and invalidation, not just handler execution.
- Accepted commands use independent execution contexts and drain during shutdown. Agent work is cancelable through broker lifecycle contexts.
- `/stop` runs out of band and cancels only the current session's active agent request, preserving queued prompts. Admin `/stop all` cancels active and queued agent work, not commands or durable background jobs.
- Formation and compaction share one low-priority model permit. It is admitted only with no outstanding foreground work; accepted foreground work cancels its active context so the durable job can refund/defer.

### Account And Command Contracts

User commands are `/help`, `/connect`, `/disconnect`, `/reset`, `/stop`, `/memories`, `/documents`, `/bootstrap`, and `/mcp`. Administrative operations include `/stop all`, `/users`, `/user`, `/admin`, `/unadmin`, `/ban`, `/unban`, `/deleteuser`, `/global-memory`, and `/mcp global`; the same `/documents` command automatically uses global scope for administrators. See command definitions for exact argument syntax.

- Account-link challenges last ten minutes. Store hashes, expiry, and consumption/replay identity, not plaintext codes. A new outgoing challenge invalidates the user's prior active one.
- The initiator's canonical account remains the owner after a merge; admin status is preserved if either participant is admin. Reject banned participants, conflicting accounts for the same gateway, and conflicting user MCP names. Frozen session-profile selection follows the separate generation/snapshot rules below.
- Confirmation atomically moves accounts, memory/session state, jobs, summaries, and reencrypted MCP ownership before deleting the losing user. Verify loser-owned rows are absent before commit. Same-confirmer replay can return the prior result without another merge.
- `/disconnect` cannot remove the final account. An administrator cannot unadmin, ban, or delete themselves.
- `/bootstrap` promotes the submitting account's currently resolved owner only while no administrator exists. Its process-local code is consumed after a successful update; restart replaces it only while no admin exists.
- `/memories list` exports all active, unexpired memories with stated/inferred/unknown origin labels, not just the model list limit. `/memories observations` exports live temporary observations and expiry. `/memories suppress <id>`, `/memories suppressions`, and `/memories unsuppress <rule-id>` manage identified-claim suppression. All use the existing authenticated user-exclusive command path and UTF-8-safe multipart bounds; export fails rather than returning a partial list. Correction remains conversational, not a separate command.
- `/memories forget <id>` requires a positive decimal ID and physically deletes the memory, candidates, affected profile references, and physical/queued derived-index state. Source conversation and summaries remain.
- `/memories forget all` uses `ResetUserDataPreservingAccount`: delete learned memory, candidates, observations, suppression rules, assessment inputs/receipts, document libraries and upload reservations, user MCP config, session turns/summaries/jobs, derived serving state, and account-link challenges; reset session generations while retaining account identity, linked accounts, moderation, speaker intro, and high-water bookkeeping.
- `/reset` advances one tenant/session generation, deletes its turns, summaries, formation/compaction work, and binds the latest profile. Durable user facts and the document library remain.
- Invalidation clears relevant gateway caches. Disconnect/delete-user can request closure of matching Home Assistant sockets; forget-all does not currently request connection closure.

## Agent And Context Management

`Agent.Process` receives `agent.Request` and returns `agent.Response`. Prompt assembly is in `agent/context.go`; tool/catalog/history helpers, image retry, streaming, and active-loop compaction coordination are separate files in that package.

1. Load the soul fresh, add trusted gateway instructions, resolve the frozen tenant profile, and retrieve tenant-scoped durable recall.
2. Load the latest summary and delivered recent exchanges for the session generation. Independently query recent successful MCP names for continuity.
3. Assemble required deployment policy, profile, current text/images, and advertised tool cost. Reserve up to two newest complete exchanges within the recent-tail allowance, then a summary if it fits, then whole recall records and additional recent exchanges.
4. Call the model; authorize calls against that iteration's exact catalog, execute allowed tools serially, append one correlated result for every declared call, and repeat.
5. Between complete tool rounds, compact when pressure requires it. On a global tool ceiling, finish with a tools-disabled model call.
6. Persist the final exchange, bounded native history, staged memory artifact, and pressure snapshot as pending delivery. The shared runtime activates post-delivery work only after the responder succeeds.

### Budget And Authority

- `compaction/budget` owns token estimation, output/safety reserves, the 70% compaction trigger, and recent-tail capacity. No model-metadata discovery is performed.
- Default context window is 32,768 tokens; default output reserve is 8,192; safety margin is 256. Nonpositive model-limit configuration selects these fallbacks. Tools and images are estimated within each actual request, not a fixed tool reserve.
- The recent-tail allowance is 25% of usable input, bounded to 2,000-8,000 tokens and never more than available input. This is the exchange allowance, not a combined summary-plus-tail allocation. Under pressure, a selected tail can take priority over the optional durable summary.
- Recall records are indivisible; a non-fitting record can be skipped while later records are considered. Additional history stops at the first complete exchange that cannot fit even after native tool history is omitted.
- Soul/gateway deployment policy is system-authority content. The profile is subordinate user-authority context; summaries, recalled facts, and historical tool results are explicitly untrusted reference data. They cannot grant authorization or tool access.
- Current attached/replied images are not replayed into later requests or persisted as image bytes. Generated images use the separate bounded session-image lifecycle below. Stored user text uses an attachment marker; reply context and injected recall are stripped from durable conversation/query text.
- Historical exchanges replay native tool calls and correlated results only when current tool availability and history policy allow it and the trace fits. Otherwise retain the exact user/final-assistant pair.
- Required context that exceeds input capacity is retained and logged; optional context is omitted. Provider usage is telemetry, not the compaction policy input.

### Failure And Persistence Behavior

- Oswald has no overall LLM generation deadline. Broker cancellation, transport errors, tool ceilings, and the independently configured gateway/provider timeout bound work.
- Each image-retry sequence allows **five total model attempts** for recognized Ollama image-runner resource failures, progressively reducing current images. This is not a request-wide submission limit; later tool rounds and corrective calls can begin another sequence. Exhaustion returns a fixed image-size fallback; unrelated errors do not use this path.
- The current Ollama/Qwen tool-parser workaround retries an identical request once. Repeated recognized parser failure returns a fallback. Empty visible responses have a separate tools-disabled corrective retry.
- A provider context-length failure can force compaction. Non-cancellation context failures use a deterministic partial-completion response that warns completed actions were not undone and retains permitted artifacts. Cancellation exits without publishing a completed turn.
- After successful image generation, non-cancellation model failures (including parser retries, tools-disabled final calls, and empty-response corrective calls) retain selected files and finalize a deterministic partial response through ordinary pending persistence and delivery gating. Ordinary failures use `response_kind=image_partial` with degraded status; context failures keep their context fallback. No `Response.Error` is set for this deliverable partial result. With no generated outputs, existing provider-error and fallback semantics remain unchanged. Cancellation still aborts without publishing a completed turn, and image persistence failure still prevents delivery.
- Ordinary session append failures may log and still return the answer. If a memory save or generated image was staged, unavailable or failed persistence returns an error instead of delivering an unpersisted save claim or silently selecting an older image on the next turn.
- Pending or failed-delivery turns cannot enter durable summaries, transcript search, or background memory extraction. Late successful delivery can clear a timeout failure and restore eligibility. Document admission/extraction is independent of turn delivery.

## Memory And Compaction

| Layer | Canonical Location | Write Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Soul | `data/memory/soul/soul.md` | Operator filesystem access only |
| Global facts about Oswald | `global_memories` | Administrator commands |
| Durable user facts | `memory_entries` and candidate evidence | Post-delivery formation |
| Conversation continuity | `sessions`, `session_turns`, `session_summaries` | Agent persistence and validated compaction |
| User document library | `user_documents`, `user_document_sources`, `user_document_chunks` | Authenticated upload admission and lease-fenced local extraction |

### User Documents

Documents are private canonical-user libraries across sessions and linked gateways, including addressed group requests. They are not group-shared documents or personal-memory evidence. The sender's own library can inform a group answer, which is visible to that group. Home Assistant can retrieve an existing library but cannot upload files. There are no native model file blocks or vision-based PDF processing: the model receives bounded extracted text, not source files or PDF page images. Ordinary images retain the separate vision path, not document OCR ingestion.

- Only supported **current** Discord/iMessage attachments become lazy document loaders; replied-to documents remain unsupported attachment labels and are not imported. Normal mention/reply, authentication, ban, and broker admission rules apply before document download. Command attachments do not run agent admission. Routing accepts PDF, text/Markdown, CSV/TSV, JSON/XML/HTML, DOC/DOCX/ODT/RTF, PPT/PPTX/ODP, XLSX/ODS, and its explicit source/config extension allowlist in `gateway/routing/documents.go`; this is narrower than the extractor's extension list. Image MIME takes precedence over document classification; MIME-based document selection is used only without an extension. Legacy XLS and arbitrary binary files are unsupported.
- Before downloading, reserve up to four file slots, 20 MiB per file, and 40 MiB aggregate source bytes, plus 1 MiB extracted capacity per file. Unknown/nonpositive transport sizes reserve the full 20 MiB per file; declared positive sizes are download ceilings, not estimates that may grow. Loaders enforce actual streamed bytes, a two-minute overall deadline, and at most three redirects. Discord URLs/redirects require HTTPS on port 443 at `cdn.discordapp.com` or `media.discordapp.net`; BlueBubbles requires the configured exact scheme/host. These are transport-origin restrictions, not `web.fetch`'s validated-IP dialing boundary.
- SQLite immediate transactions serialize reservations and admission across owners/handles. Five-minute upload reservations are single-use and nonrenewable; successful acceptance atomically consumes them, inserts source BLOBs/metadata/extraction jobs, and releases unused capacity. Failed or canceled work attempts independent five-second cleanup; otherwise expiry releases capacity. Owner-scoped admission keys deduplicate only exact source-hash/filename/media-type retries, under a new reservation after consumption. Admission commits independently of model success, session persistence, and response delivery. The initial request does **not** await extraction jobs, and there is no automatic completion notification; later catalog/search/read requests observe status.

| Library Limit | Per Canonical User | Global |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retained documents plus reserved slots | 50 | No separate count cap |
| Source bytes plus upload reservations | 250 MiB | 2 GiB |
| Extracted bytes plus extraction/upload reservations | 25 MiB | 200 MiB |

- Limits include physically retained expired documents until cleanup; live reservations count once. Each queued/extracting document reserves 1 MiB until terminal publication/failure. Stored extracted usage counts UTF-8 text **plus locator and method bytes**, not tokens/runes: at most 1 MiB per document, 1,024 contiguous zero-based chunks, 16 KiB text per chunk, 1,024-byte locator and 64-byte method. Acceptance/expiry/reservation/lease timestamps are integer Unix **milliseconds**; acceptance is UTC at millisecond precision and expiry is exactly 30 days from acceptance, not last access or session activity.
- File-backed admission also checks filesystem bytes available to the process before reservation and before BLOB insertion: require `256 MiB + 2 * (new source bytes + global reserved source bytes + global reserved text bytes)`. The reservation check includes the proposed reservation; acceptance consumes its own upload reservation before checking, without double charging it. Existing database/WAL bytes already reduce filesystem availability. Unknown/failed disk probes reject uploads; in-memory stores skip the disk check. Linux uses `statfs` available blocks; the non-Linux probe fails closed. This is a snapshot against database/WAL growth, not a filesystem quota, parser temporary-space reservation, or guarantee against unrelated writers.
- Expired documents immediately leave model serving. Maintenance physically deletes expired documents and reservations in separately bounded selections (default 100 each), cascading sources/chunks/extraction jobs. `/reset` and ordinary session expiry preserve the library; `/memories forget all` and account deletion remove it and upload reservations. Account merge moves the library atomically or rejects the entire merge on combined quota overflow, drops the losing owner's in-flight reservations, requeues its running extraction, and invalidates old leases. Winner admission mappings prevail on key collisions. Document deletion cannot erase transcripts, delivered quotations, logs, or backups; derived document index cleanup follows the asynchronous lifecycle described below.
- The agent builds separate user-authority, explicitly untrusted reference context: at most 20 newest catalog entries within 5,000 bytes and up to three search excerpts within a 12,000-byte assembled envelope, using at most the first 250 query runes. Whole JSON records fit only in remaining actual prompt capacity, including images/tools, and are refitted after active compaction. Document context is not concatenated into authored/current-user/public transcript text or formation evidence. Document tool traces are metadata-only and not transcript-search content; final answers and active compaction may still quote excerpts. Catalog omission and empty search do not prove a processing document has been read or lacks content.
- All three document tools require the authenticated canonical owner and remain private even for administrators; no tool argument grants global scope. List defaults to 20, maximum 50, excluding expired metadata. Search defaults to five, maximum ten, with an optional exact document ID and query bounds of 400 runes/1,024 UTF-8 bytes; it uses canonical lexical plus optional FTS/vector retrieval, not merely literal substring search. Excerpts are at most 1,500 runes. Read defaults to three chunks, maximum eight. Storage retains zero-based whole-chunk paging; the tool adds optional zero-based rune `text_offset` within the starting `offset` chunk. When `HasMore` is true, continue with both `offset=NextOffset` and `text_offset=NextTextOffset`: nonzero text offsets resume the same chunk, zero starts the next chunk. `Partial` marks pages containing a chunk fragment; ordinals, locators, and methods are preserved, and queued/failed documents can return metadata without readable chunks. All three tools cap their complete encoded JSON output at 16 KiB. Read splits oversized text at rune boundaries with advancing cursors rather than dropping an oversized first chunk; list/search drop whole trailing records, with list reporting `truncated`. Encoding disables optional HTML escaping but still accounts for mandatory JSON escaping and all metadata/cursor bytes. Duplicate blocking is enabled, without custom argument normalization or per-tool execution/failure/unproductive ceilings.

Local extraction uses native UTF-8 text/structured parsers, Poppler page text, English Tesseract OCR for pages with fewer than 40 alphanumeric characters, and LibreOffice-to-PDF conversion for word-processing/presentation formats. XLSX/ODS use ZIP/XML parsing, never LibreOffice or formula evaluation: cached formula values are labeled and may be stale, missing caches mark partial, numeric date serials remain raw, and drawings/comments/charts/embedded files are not spreadsheet text. HTML fetches no resources and executes no JavaScript; XML rejects DTDs and nesting beyond 64.

- Extraction allows 100 PDF pages, 25 OCR pages, one retained raster with edges at most 3,000 pixels and at most nine million pixels, 100 spreadsheet sheets/10,000 cells, and 10,000 CSV/TSV rows. CSV/TSV preflight checks the entire input before allocating fields: at most 1,024 fields and 256 KiB raw bytes per logical record, including quotes/embedded newlines. ZIP checks cover at most 2,048 entries, 32 MiB total actual inflation/CRC, and a 200:1 ratio limit for members over 1 MiB; reject unsafe/duplicate names, encrypted/nonregular entries, and symlinks. Archives are not unpacked to disk. Output text truncation and bounded omissions mark partial; the worker's stricter text-plus-metadata/chunk budget can omit more.
- Linux subprocesses use fixed executable paths without a shell, a minimal environment without inherited credentials/proxies, private `/tmp` directories, server-owned filenames, and fresh LibreOffice profiles with fixed import/export filters and macro/plugin/update restrictions. First-use exit code 81 permits one restart under the same deadline. `prlimit` sets per-process 1 GiB address space, 150 CPU seconds, 128 descriptors, zero core size, and 32 MiB per file; stdout is capped at 1 MiB and stderr discarded. A 25 ms watchdog checks 64 MiB aggregate temporary files and 2,048 filesystem entries; it can overshoot and does not bound unlinked open files. Cleanup removes temporary directories and kills ordinary process-group descendants on success/error/cancellation. This is **not a sandbox**: no filesystem/network isolation or containment of escaped sessions is implemented; importer vulnerabilities/external-resource access remain possible. Hostile input requires deployment-owned OS isolation and disk quotas.
- Worker document statuses are `queued`, `extracting`, `ready`, `partial`, `failed`; separate `user_document_extraction_jobs` states are `queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, not `durable_jobs` formation states. Claim/publication require an active, unbanned owner and unexpired document; exact live lease checks fence merges/deletion/reclaims. Successful partial work still marks the job `succeeded`. Useful `ErrLimit` results may publish partial; unsupported input fails as `unsupported_format`, deadline expiry as `extraction_timeout`, other extraction errors as `extraction_failed`, and empty successful output as `no_extractable_text`. Terminal failure releases extracted reservations but retains source bytes until deletion/expiry. Storage failures leave work reclaimable, not terminally retried with model credits; shutdown cancellation also leaves reclaimable work. Attempt telemetry uses `ok/ready`, `degraded/partial`, `error/failed`, `ok/canceled`, or `degraded/reclaimable` (`storage_failed`) and `degraded/stale` (`lease_lost`). Startup/lease timing is documented above.

`/documents usage [owner-cursor] | list [cursor] | forget <id|all> | confirm <code>` uses authenticated user-exclusive commands and refreshes ownership/admin authorization. Ordinary users manage only their library; administrators automatically manage **all libraries with the same syntax**, not a `global` subcommand. Commands may run in groups, exposing metadata or confirmation codes there.

- List uses ten-item opaque-ID keyset pages, includes expired retained rows, and includes canonical owners in admin scope. Usage counts retained bytes/documents, upload slots/source/text reservations, extraction reservations, and live statuses separately from expired counts; upload text is already included in total reserved text. Admin usage adds whole-application database/WAL sizes and available filesystem space (or unavailable/unknown), plus ten independently sampled owners per cursor page. Neither list pagination nor owner usage is a frozen database snapshot.
- `forget <id>` deletes one exact in-scope ID immediately, including expired rows. `forget all` captures exact IDs and owners during pagination, at most 10,000 documents, then issues a five-minute, process-local, hashed, one-use confirmation tied to the exact principal and authorization scope. Issuing a new confirmation replaces that principal's prior confirmation; all pending confirmations together retain at most 10,000 IDs and 100 entries. Uploads after capture are not selected and in-flight upload reservations are not canceled. Confirmation fences captured owners, refreshes authorization for each owner-scoped atomic batch of at most 50, and never follows a moved ID into a broader owner scope. Missing/moved IDs or another batch failure stop deletion; earlier committed batches remain deleted, partial counts are reported, and the consumed confirmation must be replaced. Global exact-ID deletion fences the current account graph against ownership moves.

Runtime populates `commands.Request.FencedUserIDs` only inside the broker's acquired exclusive-fence callback. Resolver output is not itself a held-fence grant. Document confirmations verify every captured owner against that set before any batch is deleted; single-ID and batch deletion additionally check each current row owner inside the deletion transaction via `DeleteUserDocumentsFenced`. Promotion between resolution and execution cannot expand the held owner set, and a newly created or moved-to owner outside that set is rejected with no deletion in that batch. Direct unscheduled document deletion has no fence grant and is rejected; direct tests must explicitly provide synthetic held owners. Administrator authorization is still refreshed separately and is never granted by fence membership.

Safe INFO events include `agent.documents.loaded`, `memory.documents.complete`, `memory.documents.disk.complete`, `documents.extraction.complete`, `documents.job.complete`, worker lifecycle events, and committed `memory.documents.expired` cleanup. Filenames, admission/confirmation keys, URLs, source/extracted content, and subprocess output are not logged. Maintenance includes `user_document_deleted_count` and `user_document_reservation_deleted_count`; extraction attempts and derived-index work are distinct measurement owners, not extra addressed requests.

### Durable User Memory

- Ownership is the canonical user, shared across linked accounts. Addressed group turns deliberately use the sender's private memory; groups do not create a shared memory tenant.
- Categories are `identity`, `communication_preferences`, `durable_preferences`, `projects`, `relationships`, `environment`, and `notes`.
- `user_memory_save` stages at most five current-turn observations; it does not publish canonical memory inline. Evidence is model-assessed as a direct statement or inference with finite confidence from 0 to 1.
- Retained `pattern-v1` extraction receives a frozen window of two to eight delivered user turns. It returns at most three patterns, each supported by two to five distinct whole-turn observations including the newest anchor. Current `assessment-v1` uses the separate frozen anchor/observation contract below. Repetition provides corroboration, not a fixed confidence increment.
- Current formation validates structure, source membership, exact evidence, category-compatible claim identity, tenant ownership, delivery, and leases. It does not apply regex semantic rejection of credentials, directives, negations, quotations, or third-party content. Do not document those classes as categorically unsavable.
- Confidence below 0.35 remains proposed evidence; approved evidence can publish or reinforce a canonical claim. An approved candidate without a published memory link can be blocked by a stronger conflicting claim. Sensitivity is retained independently and does not prompt conversational confirmation.
- Stable `(claim_slot, claim_value)` identity consolidates equivalent evidence. Same-turn reconciliation does not double-count. Canonical statement, confidence, and provenance come from one selected assessment, never independent confidence/provenance maxima. Legacy `.fact` slots are multi-valued; current assessments carry explicit cardinality.
- `provenance_type` determines serving authority: `user_statement` is user-direct, `model_inference` is model-derived, otherwise unknown. Inference is labeled possible below 0.5, likely below 0.8, and high-confidence at or above 0.8.
- Candidate insertion/reconciliation, publication/reinforcement, supersession, profile advancement, and index outbox changes commit together under lease/source fencing. Derived FTS/vector writes are asynchronous.

### Profiles And Retrieval

- Profiles compile eligible active, unexpired long-term facts into at most 2,000 **bytes**. Identity/communication facts need confidence at least 0.8; durable preferences/environment need at least 0.9. Other categories are not profile facts. `tenant-profile-v4` quotes each fact's nonempty assessment context alongside its statement as one indivisible budgeted record and includes context in the digest. Ordinary active sessions keep their frozen renderer/content; correction repair uses the current renderer.
- Normal publication does not refresh an already-bound profile. New, expired, or reset sessions bind the latest version. Explicit deletion recompiles affected snapshots; this can include other newly eligible facts.
- Account merge preserves frozen snapshots, remaps generation collisions and profile versions, and retains high-water marks. It is not an automatic refresh of every active conversation to the unified profile.
- `sessions` stores the frozen text, digest, renderer, speaker intro, source memory IDs, and version/generation high-water. Fact count comes from the checked source-ID JSON array; byte size comes from frozen UTF-8 text.
- Automatic recall combines lexical FTS5 and optional semantic sqlite-vec results, then applies relevance thresholds, confidence/importance/recency/authority ranking, duplicate suppression, diversity, and output limits. Failure of one channel does not relax tenant filtering.
- `user_memory_search` uses the hybrid engine for deeper recall; `user_memory_list` lists active facts. `session_transcript_search` is lexical search over complete delivered exchanges. Private requests retain exact authenticated tenant/session/generation scope and permitted persisted tool history. Discord channel/thread and iMessage group requests search public prompts and final replies across participants in the exact gateway/chat, never hidden tool traces or enriched model input (including the caller's own). Each source session and the caller's session must be active, unexpired, and generation-matched independently. Defaults are five results, maximum ten, within a 12,000-byte result-accounting cap.
- Group provenance and original transport user text are captured before mention, embed, reply, attachment, or model enrichment and written immutably with new turns. Empty public text stays empty; it never falls back to internal prompt text. Legacy turns remain unshared without backfill. Group excerpts contain only public user/final-assistant records and canonical speaker/turn attribution, omitting raw source session IDs. Scope comes from trusted request metadata, not tool arguments or session-key parsing. Ambient messages remain unpersisted; session history, profiles, compaction, and broker lanes remain user-scoped. Source reset/deletion/expiry removes eligibility, but cannot erase already delivered responses or copies recalled into another turn.
- Global memory is not automatically injected. `global_memory_search` retrieves administrator-curated deployment/implementation facts and returns bounded newline-delimited JSON. Both derived channels may fall back to a bounded canonical scan. Global additions normalize/deduplicate and enforce 1,000 runes; they do not filter credentials or instruction-like content.

### Durable Formation

Current `assessment-v1` replaces new pattern jobs and covers every eligible delivered anchor, including a one-turn conversation. Storage freezes the anchor and up to seven earlier turn IDs at enqueue. Under an exact live lease it then freezes at most two recent context exchanges, up to six relevant distinct-source observations, up to twenty canonical memories with revisions, and up to twenty suppression rules. Selection ranks bounded canonical pools (100 live observations, 100 recent memories plus explicit foreground targets, 100 recent active rules) using lexical overlap and recency; publication still checks all matching rules. It excludes current/future-turn observations. Retries reuse the frozen selection. Prior assistant responses and staged foreground candidates are interpretation/deduplication context only. Trusted timestamps accompany source text; fresh evidence must be a contiguous anchor-user span (public prompt for group turns). Referenced observations may support a broader claim with a different identity, but must belong to frozen tenant membership, remain unexpired, and come from distinct sources other than the anchor. Exact attribution does not establish semantic entailment.

Foreground v3 and background assessment batches use one transaction for proposals, observations, publication, retirement, evidence links, profile repair, and replay receipts. Original v2 artifacts and old extractor contracts retain their decoders. New foreground correction/retirement requires direct current evidence and a target ID/revision obtained through recall/search/list; missing metadata is retryable tool feedback, not a staged publication promise. Search/list expose canonical revision, claim identity, and assessment context. There is no extra required foreground model call, and temporary observations are not automatically injected into foreground profiles.

- `memory_observations` retains at most five admitted observations per source turn, 100 live rows per owner, and 128 KiB of observation text/claim fields per owner. Default lifetime is seven days, maximum thirty, measured from the trusted source turn timestamp rather than worker execution. At capacity, evict oldest automatic observations first; automatic admissions cannot evict explicit `remember` observations. Per-turn hash receipts retain the five-admission ceiling across eviction and foreground/background writes. Admitted observations survive source-session reset and ordinary source expiry; maintenance deletes expired observations independently. Forget-all/account deletion removes them. Replay receipts retain hashes, not expired evidence text.
- Corrections and retirements require a target ID and expected revision. Missing, inactive, or revision-stale targets reject the item rather than forcing immutable-artifact retries. Newer same-claim assessments replace one coherent tuple, including lower confidence, while preserving direct authority against automatic inference downgrades. Newer source-turn ordering prevents delayed assessments from overwriting newer canonical state. `assessment_context` persists temporal context; `retired_at` and `retirement_reason` distinguish explicit retirement, replacement, and confidence falling below serving eligibility while retaining the legacy status CHECK. Retirement never invents an opposite fact. Changed canonical assessments and inactive/deleted profile sources repair affected frozen copies.
- `memory_suppressions` blocks exact canonical claim identities on current and retained legacy publication paths. Suppression physically deletes matching canonical entries, linked candidates, matching observations, and physical/queued derived-index artifacts through the shared hard-delete transaction routine, retaining the rule and repairing profiles. Unsuppression permits new source evidence, not old replay; inactive source cutoffs also protect correction, retirement, automatic replacement, and explicit deletion. Observation-to-memory evidence links are tenant-checked and capped at five. Account merge moves observations, receipts, frozen inputs, rules, and evidence relationships, consolidates duplicate rules, reapplies suppression, and enforces the combined observation bounds.
- `memory.assessment.applied` reports committed transaction counts without payloads; formation owns terminal job reporting. Maintenance includes committed `observation_deleted_count`, `assessment_receipt_deleted_count`, and `observation_receipt_deleted_count` in its sweep measurement and row-operation total. Hash receipts are collected in bounded batches only after the non-reusable source turn is absent and no live retained observation or nonterminal frozen observation-dependent job needs them. Rollbacks do not report receipt deletions as committed.

Suppression and cutoff matching treats underscores and spaces as compatible value separators without removing other punctuation; slots still match exactly. Revision-target corrections carry the exact target ID through publication, never a legacy normalized-statement lookup. The common proposal/publication boundary also rejects retained artifacts older than an assessed canonical claim. During merge, inactive cutoffs remove stale canonical copies but preserve an explicitly retained current assessment by its trusted source turn ID; source metadata comes from the selected coherent tuple rather than an independent maximum. Unchanged reinforcement does not refresh an already-bound profile. Frozen inputs remain bounded to 1 MiB; stale targets removed during merge are rejected, not resolved through an ID-alias layer.

`memory/formation` orchestrates jobs; `memory/formation_jobs.go` and `memory/candidate_store.go` own transactional state.

- Model-backed formation has **three durable provider-submission credits**, reserved immediately before invocation. Successful submissions consume credit too. Operational failures and the one invalid-output corrective retry share that budget.
- Current extraction forces one private `user_memory_assess` call, `tool_choice = "required"`, no parallel tool calls, temperature 0, and an output cap of the lesser of 4,096 tokens and the resolved reserve. Input is bounded by 6,000 estimated tokens and the configured model's usable capacity, including prompt/schema costs. It projects contiguous source prefixes and whole optional records, flags omissions, and validates fresh output against the exact projected text/IDs. INFO `user_memory.formation.input.projected` reports safe input/omission counts. Invalid output gets at most one reason-aware corrective retry; prior raw model output is not replayed. Retained pattern jobs keep their old private tool and whole-turn contract, including the 1,000-rune evidence rejection limit.
- Persist the first valid decoded artifact for idempotent replay. Replaying it does not invoke the model. Local `agent_save` jobs do not consume provider credit and retain bounded storage retry behavior.
- Renewable exact-token leases begin at five minutes. Publication requires a live exact lease; retry/skip release paths retain exact-token ownership checks even after natural expiry.
- Intentional foreground preemption refunds the reserved submission, restores the claimed attempt, and durably defers work regardless of remote acceptance. Startup backfill considers missing jobs only for eligible delivered turns from the preceding 24 hours.

### Session Compaction

`compaction.NewLLMCompactor` supplies the shared model-backed compactor. `compaction/service.go` plans/runs durable jobs; `agent/compaction.go` installs request-local checkpoints; `memory` stores jobs, summaries, and delivery state.

- `AppendPendingSessionTurn(ctx, SessionTurnWrite)` writes a generation-fenced exchange and immutable history, staged memory, pressure, and outbox artifacts. Pressure requires nonnegative tokens, a positive limit, and a nonblank version. Persistence is not delivery acknowledgement.
- At 70% estimated usable-input pressure, durable planning pins a campaign target through the newest eligible delivered exchange. Jobs cover at most 64 exchanges; successful partial checkpoints continue the campaign even if pressure falls.
- Each job pins model/generator contracts. One queued/running/retry job per tenant/session/generation prevents overlap; failed contracts and uncompactable complete-exchange receipts suppress repeated work until the contract or scope changes.
- `PageDeliveredSessionTurnsAfter` pages ascending IDs across pending gaps for foreground history. Advance its exclusive boundary to the last returned ID. `CompactionWindowAfter` instead respects pending-delivery barriers and reports the eligible total/newest ID independently of page size.
- Durable jobs have four provider submissions and up to three structured-output corrective retries within those four credits. Permanent provider 4xx failures skip immediately except 408, 425, and 429. Foreground compaction also shares four submissions across its chunks/retries.
- Compaction artifact saves, first summary publication, and successful/skipped completion require the caller's exact live lease token, even after same-owner renewal or reclaim. The worker serializes renewal with submission reservation and carries the final renewed token into publication or preemption bookkeeping. Replaying an already-published summary remains an idempotent scope-checked read, not permission to complete a job under a stale lease.
- Compaction uses a silent synchronous stream, one required `session_summary_save` tool call, no parallel calls, temperature 0, and the resolved output limit. Provider schema omits grammar-expensive cardinality/string-length constraints; local validation still enforces limits.
- A summary contains narrative, open tasks, commitments, entities, decisions, topic tags, covered range, and ordered source IDs. Narrative is bounded to 8,000 runes; arrays to 50 items each, items to 1,000 runes, aggregate structured text to 16,000 runes, and encoded artifact to 40,000 bytes.
- Foreground compaction includes delivered post-checkpoint exchanges and completed active tool rounds, using live model-visible arguments/results rather than durable-history truncation. Reasoning and attachment bytes are excluded. Install a checkpoint only after validation; keep the old context on failure.
- Durable summaries do not delete covered transcripts or publish user memories. Active-generation transcripts remain searchable after compaction.

### Persisted Compatibility

Retained `formation-v4` jobs/artifacts still use their single-turn decoder and stricter legacy evidence policy. Current pattern and foreground behavior must not be inferred from those legacy rejection rules.

New compaction output requires an empty `candidates` array. Persisted summary artifacts retain a legacy candidate field: decoding still validates structural and size bounds, but summary publication neither evaluates those candidates as new user evidence nor publishes them. Keep these decoders and the existing artifact version/JSON contracts while stored data can require them.

## SQLite, Indexing, And Retention

The canonical database is `config.DefaultDatabasePath`, currently `data/database/oswald.db` relative to the working directory. Accounts, MCP, global memory, and user memory open separate handles to it. Initialization is serialized by a process schema mutex.

- Permanent SQL migrations are embedded, semantically ordered `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.sql` files. Current history is `v4.0.0` through `v4.0.14`, fifteen ledger rows. Sequence numbers are application order, not release versions; SHA-256 protects release name plus SQL.
- Accept empty databases or an exact applied prefix of that registry. Reject nonempty ledgerless/development schemas and checksum drift without modifying canonical schema/data. There is no pre-v4 importer.
- Apply missing migrations on one connection in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction with foreign-key actions temporarily disabled, check foreign keys before commit, and restore enforcement afterward. Never edit a released migration.
- `durable_jobs` contains typed formation, compaction, and derived-index work. Job-kind checks and tenant/source/lease predicates are part of the persistence contract, not redundant metadata.
- Canonical state remains authoritative when indexes are absent. Derived kinds are `memory_fts`, `transcript_fts`, `memory_vector`, `global_memory_fts`, `global_memory_vector`, `user_document_fts`, and `user_document_vector`.
- Document chunks use non-reusable internal integer IDs mapped to `(document_id, ordinal)` for the `user_document_chunk` outbox entity. Immutable chunks, transactional publication/deletion/ownership triggers, and periodic reconciliation feed the existing revision worker. Only ready/partial, unexpired, tenant-owned chunks are indexable. Search always includes canonical lexical matches to cover index lag, fuses optional FTS and semantic ranks, and rechecks current ownership/status/expiry before returning bounded excerpts. Semantic queries require configured embeddings and use the live revision's model during replacement; exact vector distance is evaluated over the quota-bounded private library, not a cross-tenant top-k pool. Existing index lifecycle and document-search measurements cover these paths; unavailable channels warn without exposing content. Deleted/expired chunks immediately lose serving eligibility; physical derived cleanup is asynchronous, except account-wide deletion's existing physical cleanup.
- Canonical mutations enqueue outbox work transactionally. Indexing applies it to relevant live/building revisions, validates canonical version and ownership, and retries without weakening filters.
- Rebuild into generated shadow tables, validate physical dimension/schema/model, exact canonical and valid indexed counts, tenant joins, memory eligibility, and delivered active-generation transcript eligibility, then atomically switch the live pointer. Failed shadows do not replace working indexes.
- Transcript FTS schema 3 adds public prompt and group provenance columns. Group matching uses only public prompt/final-answer columns plus exact canonical scope and indexed-content checks. Persisted schema-2 live indexes remain writable and privately searchable during rebuild; group search is unavailable until schema 3 is published. Public answers and provenance are immutable; legacy rows cannot be opted into sharing by later updates.
- Generated names must match their recorded kind/revision before publication or cleanup. Retained revision metadata preserves high-water and prevents name reuse.
- Indexing reconciles at startup and polls every 30 seconds plus mutation wakeups. During model replacement, semantic queries use the old live model until publication; that model must remain accessible. Embedding dimension is cached after the first successful probe until restart.

`config.DefaultRetentionPolicy()` supplies these code-owned values; environment overrides are not supported. Tests can inject policies.

| Policy | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Retired/failed physical index-table retention | 168 hours |
| Session inactivity | 24 hours |
| Pending delivery timeout | 15 minutes |
| Successful/skipped job history | 168 hours |
| Dead-job and unpublished-candidate history | 720 hours |
| Account-link challenge cleanup grace | 24 hours after expiry |
| Maintenance schedule | Immediately, then hourly |
| Minimum database optimize interval | 24 hours |
| Rows selected per maintenance operation | 100 |

- Expired user memories are hidden on reads. Maintenance marks due active rows expired, blanks their statement/claim identity, retains the canonical row and remaining metadata, and queues index deletion. Explicit forget is physical deletion; expiry is not equivalent.
- Session-serving queries require a matching active, unexpired generation. Delivered turns remain usable for that session lifetime even if the turn's own expiry has passed. Expiry cleanup removes artifacts but retains inactive session bookkeeping/high-water rows.
- Inactive compaction work can first be retired/skipped and detached from summaries, with terminal retention applied later. Do not equate every cleanup count with immediate row deletion.
- Keep active-generation failed-contract compaction receipts and one newest successful upsert receipt per still-eligible canonical entity. They prevent repeated failing compaction and needless reindexing, respectively.
- Maintenance is serialized but not one atomic sweep: expiry cleanup, further canonical retention, and derived/database hygiene have separate commit/error boundaries. Later failure does not roll back earlier committed cleanup. Batch size bounds selected rows per operation, not a whole-category or whole-sweep deletion total.
- SQLite uses foreign keys, `secure_delete=ON`, WAL, `synchronous=NORMAL`, a five-second busy timeout, immediate write locks, and a 1,000-page automatic WAL checkpoint. Sweeps perform a passive checkpoint, `incremental_vacuum(100)` only if already in incremental-vacuum mode, and `PRAGMA optimize` when due.

### Backups And Container Paths

Use SQLite online `.backup`, or stop Oswald before copying the database together with any WAL/SHM companions. A live copy of the main file alone is unsafe. Keep the exact MCP encryption key separately. Restore while stopped, remove stale destination WAL/SHM files, and require `PRAGMA integrity_check` to return `ok` plus an empty `PRAGMA foreign_key_check` before restart. External backups and logs need independent retention/access controls; application deletion cannot erase their copies.

The Docker working directory is `/home/oswald-ai/`, so the default database resolves to `/home/oswald-ai/data/database/oswald.db`. The image creates that database directory owned by the nonroot `oswald-ai` user with mode 0700; mount/persist the path actually used. `EXPOSE 8000` neither configures a gateway nor publishes a host port. Runtime includes `ffmpeg`, SQLite tools, Poppler, Tesseract with English data, LibreOffice Writer/Calc/Impress, fonts, and util-linux (`prlimit`). Sources/documents live in SQLite, not a separate upload volume; extraction uses temporary `/tmp` space. Explicit build copies and `.dockerignore` exclude local databases/credentials while retaining synthetic fixtures.

The `document-tests` Docker target inherits the same document runtime/parser packages and runs as nonroot with `sqlite_fts5,document_integration` and networking disabled. Build with `docker build --target document-tests -t oswald-document-tests .`; repeat with `docker run --rm --network=none oswald-document-tests`. These exercise installed native parsers separately from ordinary fake-backed tests; network-disabled testing does not make production extraction a sandbox.

## Tools And MCP

Builtin names live in `tools/names/names.go`; its contract test pins all thirteen strings and their exact correspondence with loaded Markdown schema names. Private formation/compaction tools are not builtin catalog entries.

| Tool | Enablement | Execution / Failure / Unproductive Limits | Durable History |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `time.current` | Always | 0 / 0 / 0 | Full |
| `user_memory_save` | Always | 2 / 0 / 0 | Metadata |
| `user_memory_search` | Always | 0 / 0 / 0 | Full |
| `user_memory_list` | Always | 0 / 0 / 0 | Full |
| `session_transcript_search` | Always | 0 / 0 / 0 | Full |
| `global_memory_search` | Always | 0 / 0 / 0 | Full |
| `user_document_list` | Always; authenticated private library | 0 / 0 / 0 | Metadata; not searchable |
| `user_document_search` | Always; authenticated private library | 0 / 0 / 0 | Metadata; not searchable |
| `user_document_read` | Always; authenticated private library | 0 / 0 / 0 | Metadata; not searchable |
| `web.search` | Brave or SearXNG configured | 0 / 2 / 2 | Full |
| `web.fetch` | Same enablement as search | 4 / 2 / 2 | Metadata |
| `comfyui.text_to_image` | ComfyUI configured; hidden from Home Assistant | 0 / 0 / 0 | Metadata |
| `comfyui.image_to_image` | ComfyUI configured; hidden from Home Assistant even when an image exists | 0 / 0 / 0 | Metadata |

Zero disables a per-tool guard; it does not bypass global limits. Full history is bounded and searchable; metadata-only fetch/save/image/document results are not persisted as full model/tool content. Default per-call durable-history bounds are 16 KiB of arguments and 16,000 result runes; the complete trace has additional aggregate bounds.

- `governance.DefaultGlobalPolicy()` caps requests at 50 actual handler executions and 30 model responses containing tool calls. There is no request-wide consecutive-failure guard.
- Authorize against the exact catalog advertised for that iteration. Discovery cannot authorize another call in the same model-emitted batch. Complete every declared call with a correlated result, including blocked calls, before finishing with tools disabled.
- Duplicate detection hashes the name and canonical normalized arguments. Successful/unproductive calls retain fingerprints; execution errors release them for exact retry. Per-tool exhaustion hides only that tool.
- Image-to-image duplicate detection includes the effective source ID, explicit strength, and `create_variant` (omitted equals false). The agent resolves an omitted selector from its current default source before fingerprinting each call, so a newly generated default permits another identical edit prompt. Explicit selectors remain exact-match values and still undergo handler validation; identical prompts targeting the same source with the same strength and variant mode remain duplicates, while changed strength permits a retry. Omitted strength remains distinct from an explicit value. Text-to-image duplicate detection remains prompt-based.
- `user_memory_save` has two executions and a five-candidate request-wide staging cap. The model is instructed to use the second call for retryable corrections; runtime does not enforce that every second call is semantically a correction.
- Current time is not injected automatically: use `time.current` when needed. It accepts IANA zones/UTC and rejects host-dependent `Local`.
- The registry loads schemas and owns builtin handlers/policies/disabled-name reservations. Invalid individual Markdown specs are logged/skipped; required handler registration can then fail startup. MCP tools are supplied separately and combined by the agent.

### MCP Configuration And Exposure

- MCP is generic; GitHub-specific capabilities come from a configured remote server, not a dedicated GitHub integration in Oswald.
- User servers belong to one canonical user. Global servers are visible to all eligible users and use shared configured remote credentials, not per-user delegated OAuth. Global management commands require administrator authorization; remote writes are not admin-only merely because the server is global.
- `/mcp add <name> <https-url> [auth-bearer=<token>] [header:<name>=<value>] <description>` and `/mcp global add ...` save/update the complete configuration and invalidate the cached connection.
- Names are 2-40 lowercase ASCII characters, starting with a letter and continuing with letters, digits, or underscores; `soul` is reserved. Descriptions are trimmed, 1-500 runes, and reject controls. The stored description is used unchanged for `<server>.tools`; command tokenization may normalize input whitespace.
- `mcp_servers` stores plaintext descriptions/metadata and AES-256-GCM-encrypted URLs and headers. A fresh nonce is used per encryption; associated data binds scope, owner, server name, and field. Account merge reencrypts for the winner. The key is required even without configured servers.
- Servers without descriptions are hidden until updated. Successful MCP tools from the latest four delivered exchanges can be pre-exposed if still available to the user, independently of the summary boundary.
- Remote sessions are not opened at application startup. Discovery, testing, execution, and catalog assembly can connect lazily; assembling exposed tools may connect to all enabled described servers visible to that user.
- Discovery exposes matching names request-locally, then bounds its result listing. A large listing can omit names already exposed. Both discovery and remote-result envelopes are bounded to 16,000 runes after receipt/flattening, not by an equivalent HTTP-body cap.
- Remote read and write tools are eligible without annotation-based mutation filtering, subject to reserved-name, identifier, and simplified-schema checks. Remote `tools` is reserved. Fully qualified names must fit 64 bytes.
- MCP schema projection is not full JSON Schema support: it forwards compatible top-level object parameters, required flags, bounded descriptions, and safe string enums. Unsupported identifiers/types, malformed schemas, and non-string enums can hide tools; nested schemas and combinators are not faithfully preserved.
- Only `streamable_http` connection handling is implemented. Stored `sse` configuration is rejected when connection is attempted. The HTTP client has a 30-second timeout; initial session connection has a separate 30-second context deadline, not one total discovery/execution deadline. Non-text results may be JSON-flattened, not converted to gateway attachments.

**MCP network limitation:** URL validation requires HTTPS without userinfo and checks resolved addresses at save/connection setup against private, loopback, link-local, multicast, and unspecified classes. It does not provide `web.fetch`'s full special-range filtering, validated-IP dialing, proxy exclusion, or redirect revalidation. The default HTTP transport can resolve again/use proxies, and configured headers are reapplied to redirected requests. Treat MCP endpoints and catalogs as trusted operator/user configuration; do not claim DNS-rebinding or cross-origin credential-forwarding protection is implemented.

### Web Providers

`websearch/normalize.go` is provider-neutral. Queries are limited to 400 runes/50 words; provider bodies to 2 MiB; the first 50 source-ordered candidates are normalized into at most eight results, at most two per hostname, within a 16 KiB model envelope. Remove known tracking parameters, fragments, and duplicate URLs. Result URLs/text are untrusted; search normalization is not the direct-fetch DNS security boundary.

- Brave uses `POST https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/llm/context`, API version `2026-07-31`, US English, spellcheck, SafeSearch off, balanced relevance, eight requested URLs, and an approximate 3,072-token context budget. The shared client allows 50 attempts per rolling second and a 30-second per-attempt timeout.
- Brave retries once only for explicit 408, eligible short-window 429, or selected 5xx responses. Ambiguous transport failures/timeouts, long quota windows, and malformed/oversized successes are not retried because a metered request may already have completed. Redirects are not followed.
- SearXNG uses the configured HTTP(S) base path plus `/search`, JSON, `en-US`, general category, and first page. Engine selection/weighting is deployment-owned. It has an eight-second attempt timeout, at most one retry, and same-origin-only redirects; private SearXNG deployment addresses are permitted.
- With both providers, Brave is primary; SearXNG runs after failure or no usable result. Failure makes fallback output degraded; clean emptiness does not. Partial engine failures and truncation are reflected in bounded results, not raw backend errors.
- Search queries, URLs, provider bodies, rate-limit headers, and credentials must not be logged. Bounded successful search arguments/results can still enter full session tool history.

`web.fetch` accepts public HTTP on port 80 or HTTPS on port 443. It validates every DNS answer, dials an exact validated IP, disables environment proxies and connection reuse, rejects userinfo/secret-like query keys/local or special destinations, and revalidates up to three redirects without HTTPS downgrade.

Fetch has a 15-second overall deadline, bounded headers, a 2 MiB direct decoded-body cap, and a 16 KiB model envelope. It extracts HTML/XHTML, plain text, and JSON; recognized public X/Twitter status URLs try the public oEmbed endpoint first with guarded direct fallback. It cannot render JavaScript, bypass authentication/challenges, or extract PDF/binary media. Arguments/results use metadata-only durable history.

### ComfyUI

ComfyUI handlers accept positive/negative prompts, each bounded to 2,000 runes. Image-to-image is advertised even without current images. Its optional `source_image_id` selects from an agent-owned catalog of current attached/replied images (`current-1`, etc.) and opaque generated IDs. Unknown or invalid IDs fail without a generation request. Omission selects the latest output generated in this request, otherwise the first current image, otherwise the newest retained delivered session output. Without any source, the tool returns an error; the model can ask for an image or generate one. For the existing gateways, tools are hidden from Home Assistant; the implementation currently checks the gateway name rather than a generic attachment-capability interface.

- After a successful ComfyUI tool call, the agent normalizes its output and returns server-owned `image_id`, `version`, immutable asset `source_image_id`, and exact `parent_source_image_id` (empty for text-to-image). Text-to-image creates a logical image. Image-to-image advances the selected logical image by default; editing an attached source establishes its request-local logical identity. Boolean `create_variant=true` creates a separate logical image instead. Retrying an ancestor advances the logical high-water mark, not the ancestor version. Reservations happen before provider work and can leave gaps on failure. Retained rows carry synchronized high-water marks scoped to their active owner/session/generation, surviving reopen and turn-based account moves without a separate unbounded counter table. Migration v4.0.13 initializes each legacy asset as its own logical image at version one. Counters disappear with the last retained asset; unavailable logical IDs cannot be selected to resurrect them.
- Up to four latest normalized outputs, including intermediate drafts, are injected as user-authority reference images after each complete tool-result batch. This context survives active compaction and uses existing image retries and token estimation. Current images remain separate, so active model input can include four current plus four generated images. The active edit catalog holds at most 24 assets, evicting oldest unselected sources while pinning selected deliverables. Same-request edits can select retained intermediate assets without waiting for delivery.
- Final delivery selects the latest successful version of each logical image produced THIS request in first-production order, preserving unrelated attachments and their relative positions. Loaded sources are not automatically delivered. A fifth logical deliverable is rejected with actionable tool feedback before provider submission; edits of selected logical images remain allowed. Failed edits leave prior successes selected. Agent tool chunks carry status but no attachments; Discord also ignores chunk attachments, sending only the authoritative final inventory through its existing retry worker.
- Selected images are persisted in successful generation order, independently of attachment delivery order. Descending stored ordinals therefore load the most recently generated selected asset first: producing A, B, then A-v2 delivers A-v2 followed by B, but the next omitted-source edit defaults to A-v2.
- `session_images` stores actual normalized PNG/JPEG BLOBs (not original full-resolution outputs), at most 280 KiB each, four per turn and eight per canonical-user/session across generations (at most 2,240 KiB). ONLY selected final request outputs are written atomically with the pending turn, with logical/version/parent metadata. Oldest assets are evicted on insertion and ownership moves, including pending assets in the bound; failed new deliveries can therefore displace old assets. Image bytes never enter durable tool history, summaries, or transcript indexes; metadata-only tool history also omits source IDs. Model-authored text or transient compaction evidence may still mention IDs. Prior assets are advertised as IDs, not automatically injected as vision input, and their bytes are available to the edit handler.
- Prior outputs require a delivered, nonfailed turn in the exact owner/session/current active generation, and unexpired session and source-turn TTL (normally 24 hours from generation). Turn-linked ownership follows account merges and generation remapping, not transport IDs. Reset, forget-all, account deletion, and source-turn deletion cascade to bytes; maintenance also deletes expired image rows in bounded batches even when transcripts remain active. Ordinary memory-fact deletion does not delete session images. As with other transient artifacts, no source survives reset or becomes group-shared through transcript search. Existing backups and ComfyUI's own output files are outside this deletion boundary.
- INFO `agent.images.loaded`, `.generated`, and `.stored` report safe image counts, normalized byte sizes, load duration, and pending storage outcomes without image IDs or payloads. Generated `image_count` remains the active vision count; `selected_image_count` and `catalog_image_count` distinguish final selection from editable assets. Load/normalization/storage failures retain existing warning/tool/request outcome reporting. Maintenance reports committed direct expiry deletions as `session_image_deleted_count`; turn-cascade deletions are covered by the parent turn lifecycle, not counted again as direct image deletions.

- Workflows are operator-owned templates subject to fixed graph/model validation, not arbitrary API graphs. Current templates require `dreamshaper_8.safetensors`; image-to-image pins `dpmpp_2m` and `karras`.
- The checked-in text-to-image template uses `dpmpp_2m` / `karras`, 20 steps, CFG 7, 512x512, and batch one. Text-to-image sampler choice is template-owned, not pinned by validation. Tool guidance favors concise subject-first descriptions with distinguishing visual features and targeted negatives instead of generic quality keywords. These defaults are not a measured quality guarantee or VRAM cap; no larger model, extra conditioning network, or high-resolution pass is added.
- Supported sizes are multiples of 64 between 64 and 768, within 768x512 or 512x768; steps 1-25 and CFG 1-10. Text-to-image uses batch one/denoise one; image-to-image denoise is 0.1-0.9. Runtime replaces prompts, a fresh random seed, and the current image reference. Optional image-to-image `strength` maps directly to sampler denoise on a deep copy; omission preserves the operator template, while explicit values must be finite JSON numbers in the inclusive 0.1-0.9 range or fail before submission. Tool guidance describes the desired final image and emphasizes changed attributes, suggesting roughly 0.55-0.65 for visible changes without guarantees and warning that higher strength can change composition/identity. No model, dimensions, precision, steps, CFG, sampler, or workflow defaults change with strength; this is not a VRAM hard cap. Existing INFO `provider.comfyui.stage.complete` measurements carry numeric effective `strength` for image-to-image, including template-selected values, without prompts.
- Downloaded outputs accept PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP, at most 8 MiB, with each dimension positive and at most 8,192 pixels. Validation uses MIME checks and `image.DecodeConfig`, not full image decoding.
- One client serializes upload, submission, polling, output download, detached `/free` cleanup, and permit release. The configured generation timeout starts after permit acquisition; permit waiting remains caller-cancelable. Cleanup has a separate ten-second bound and may mark a valid output degraded on failure.
- `/free` unloads models globally, so require a dedicated or exclusively serialized ComfyUI instance. Full-resolution output uses ephemeral Oswald attachments; normalized copies use the active vision context and bounded session store above, never durable tool history. This does not imply files are deleted from ComfyUI's storage.

## Gateways And Media

| Gateway | Transport And Identity | Session Key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discord | Reconnecting Gateway WebSocket plus REST; Discord author identity | DM: `discord:dm:<author-id>`; guild/thread: `discord:<channel-id>:<author-id>` |
| iMessage | Authenticated `/bluebubbles/webhook` and BlueBubbles REST; normalized phone/email handle | DM: `imessage:dm:<sender-id>`; group: `imessage:<chat-guid>:<sender-id>` |
| Home Assistant | Bearer-authenticated `/homeassistant/ws`; trusted HA service asserts user ID | `homeassistant:<ha-user-id>:<conversation-id>` |

- Discord ignores bots, maintains heartbeat/resume/reconnection, resolves mentions, downloads attachments, and reconstructs replies. Its stream state machine displays thinking/tool/compaction activity, then cursor previews and finalized chunks under the 2,000-unit message limit. Authoritative final delivery reconciles streamed messages. Tool results remain hidden; builtin status exposes purpose-specific fields and MCP primitive arguments are bounded/secret-key-filtered.
- Discord final answers, errors, fallbacks, and command responses share one process-local FIFO delivery worker. The head is attempted immediately; transient network/read failures, HTTP 408/429/5xx, and attempt timeouts retry with 1-second exponential backoff capped at 30 seconds. Admission is bounded to 20 pending responses including the active head and 80 MiB of retained attachment data. Every entry has an independent five-minute deadline from admission, including waiting time, and each attempt has a 15-second context bound. Later final responses cannot bypass the head. Overflow, expiry, permanent failure, and shutdown return errors through the existing responder/runtime acknowledgement; successful delivery returns normally and activates the existing post-delivery path. Agent generation is already released by the broker before delivery; scheduled commands can retain their existing lane/fences while waiting. There is no connectivity monitor, configuration override, or restart persistence.
- Discord recovery retains lifecycle IDs, finalized chunks, attachment progress, and stable per-create `nonce`/`enforce_nonce` values for JSON and multipart creates. Transient final-edit failures never trigger delete/replacement; missing messages (404) retain replacement handling. Preview failures disable further previews instead of replaying intermediate updates. Discord documents nonce uniqueness only over the past few minutes, not an exact five-minute guarantee, so this is best-effort duplicate suppression rather than exactly-once delivery after ambiguous POSTs. Partial messages already delivered are not rolled back on terminal failure. INFO `gateway.outbound.admitted`, `.retry`, `.rejected`, and `.complete` report safe request correlation, counts, attachment bytes, delays, and outcomes without content or Discord identifiers; these are delivery operations, not extra addressed requests.
- Discord JSON and multipart 429 responses retain numeric `Retry-After` header or JSON `retry_after` delays. Recovery waits for at least that delay (even above the ordinary 30-second backoff cap) unless the entry expires or shutdown cancels it. Permanent attachment failure does not suppress final text, but remains a delivery failure after text delivery; transient text retries preserve chunk progress. Agent error responses finalize as text-only responses independently of the interrupted generation's attachment inventory.
- iMessage validates the BlueBubbles password through accepted password/guid query parameters or `x-password`, `x-guid`, `x-bluebubbles-guid` headers. It caches contacts/reply metadata, sends typing indicators, and delivers only the final response with a fallback send method. Cross-session replies provide quoted context, not a switch to another sender's session.
- Home Assistant requires exactly one bearer Authorization header, rejects Origin headers, sends `ready` with protocol version 1, reads one strict JSON text request, executes it, and closes. Multiple connections per user are possible. Unknown fields, binary input, anonymous users, missing conversation IDs, and blank text are rejected.
- HA incoming frames are bounded to 128 KiB with a 15-second first-message deadline. It streams correlated thinking/content/tool-call/tool-result frames and attempts at most one terminal result/error; disconnects/read/write failures can prevent delivery. Disconnect is not wired to foreground cancellation. Agent status chunks are suppressed; text command attachments are returned inline, while binary/image attachments are unsupported.

### Media Bounds

| Resource | Bound / Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Current-turn images | At most four |
| Encoded source image | At most 10 MiB each |
| Accepted source formats | JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, HEIC/HEIF, including sequence MIME variants |
| Normalized input | JPEG or PNG; longest edge at most 2,560 pixels; encoded payload at most 280 KiB before base64 |
| Animated GIF | Sampled contact-sheet image |
| Discord GIFV | 10 MiB source payload, 20-second extraction deadline, up to four sampled frames via ffmpeg/ffprobe, with static-preview fallback |
| Output attachments | At most 8 MiB each, ten files, 80 MiB total |

Validate downloaded bytes using metadata, MIME/sniffing, and format signatures. Preserve transparency with PNG; otherwise normalize to JPEG. Unsupported or unusable attachments become bounded prompt notes rather than raw binary model input. Output filenames must be basenames without separators/controls, no more than 255 bytes, and unique within the response.

Source decoding precedes resizing, and animated GIF uses full animation decoding. Encoded-byte and output-dimension limits do **not** establish a strict peak decoded-memory or animation-frame bound. Supported document uploads use the separate User Documents extraction path and limits above; arbitrary files, audio, and arbitrary video inputs remain unsupported.

## Model Gateway Transport

`llm/gateway.go` maps provider-neutral types through `gateway_wire.go`. Chat transport follows the request's streaming setting, not whether tools are present:

| Request | Transport |
| --- | --- |
| Foreground with stream callback: Discord and Home Assistant | Synchronous streaming `POST /v1/chat/completions` |
| Foreground without stream callback: iMessage | `POST /v1/async/chat/completions`, authenticated status polling |
| Private extraction and compaction | Silent synchronous chat stream |
| Embeddings | `POST /v1/async/embeddings`, authenticated status polling |

Tool rounds and final tools-disabled calls retain the foreground stream setting. Silent streams allow foreground priority to close the active background HTTP request immediately.

- The gateway must support the Bifrost async contract and have a Logs Store configured for async routes. Polling defaults to one second; Oswald does not set a total LLM-client timeout.
- Async IDs are process-local, not persisted. Cancellation/restart after submission may leave remote jobs running until completion or the provider's independently configured timeout; no async cancellation endpoint is implemented here.
- Current-turn images use OpenAI-compatible image URL content blocks. Provider-reported thinking, content, usage, and finish reasons are mapped separately.
- `MODEL_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` reserves foreground response capacity but does not send a foreground `max_tokens` cap. Private extraction/compaction send the resolved value as `max_tokens`.

## Environment Configuration

These are the 22 application variables loaded by `config.Load`. Defaults below are code defaults; explicitly empty strings generally differ from unset values.

| Variable | Default / Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `HOME_ASSISTANT_AUTH_TOKEN` | Empty; at least 32 bytes after trimming whitespace when enabling HA |
| `HOME_ASSISTANT_LISTEN_PORT` | Empty; valid port required with HA token |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_LISTEN_PORT` | Empty; valid webhook port |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_URL` | Empty; absolute HTTP(S) base without credentials/query/fragment |
| `BLUEBUBBLES_PASSWORD` | Empty; webhook and API credential |
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Empty; enables Discord when nonblank |
| `MCP_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Required at startup; base64-encoded or raw 32-byte AES key |
| `LLM_GATEWAY_URL` | `http://localhost:8080` when unset |
| `LLM_GATEWAY_MODEL` | Required nonempty route/model name |
| `LLM_GATEWAY_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Empty disables semantic indexing/retrieval |
| `LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY` | Optional bearer authentication |
| `LLM_GATEWAY_VIRTUAL_KEY` | Optional `x-bf-vk` routing header |
| `MODEL_CONTEXT_WINDOW` | 0 selects budget fallback |
| `MODEL_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | 0 selects output-reserve/private-call fallback |
| `BRAVE_API_KEY` | Empty disables Brave |
| `SEARXNG_URL` | Empty disables SearXNG |
| `COMFYUI_URL` | Empty disables image generation |
| `COMFYUI_TEXT_TO_IMAGE_WORKFLOW` | `data/workflows/comfyui/text-to-image-basic.json` |
| `COMFYUI_IMAGE_TO_IMAGE_WORKFLOW` | `data/workflows/comfyui/image-to-image-basic.json` |
| `COMFYUI_GENERATION_TIMEOUT` | Positive Go duration; default 2m |
| `WORKER_POOL_SIZE` | 1; nonpositive values normalized to one by broker |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info`; unknown values fall back to info |

- Invalid/incomplete gateway settings disable that gateway; startup fails if none are configured correctly. Ports must be integers from 1 through 65535.
- Invalid/empty integer text uses parser fallbacks. An explicitly empty/invalid/nonpositive ComfyUI duration fails config loading even if image tools are disabled. Malformed nonempty ComfyUI URLs fail config loading; malformed nonempty SearXNG URLs fail tool initialization.
- `.env.example` currently supplies HA/BlueBubbles ports and a nonempty ComfyUI URL as deployment examples. Copying that URL opts into ComfyUI; it is not the empty code default.
- Retention, maintenance, global tool limits, database/soul/schema paths, and per-tool limits are code-owned. Do not document retired environment overrides as supported. Standard-library environment behavior, such as proxies on default HTTP transports, is separate from this inventory.

## Structured Logging

The issue126 monitoring contract applies to all code and future contributions: operational data must be available at the default INFO threshold, even when no current dashboard or immediate consumer needs it. Instrument meaningful operation boundaries, outcomes, counts, latency, usage, and health rather than every line or payload. DEBUG may add safe diagnostics, but must not be the only source of required monitoring. The implementation details below describe current behavior; the contributor rules also govern new work.

Production logs are single-line JSON on stderr. Ingest stderr only. Human-readable banner/bootstrap output is stdout and can contain a bootstrap secret; exclude it from ordinary log ingestion, or apply a separate secret-safe filter if the collector cannot separate streams. Container TTYs merge streams and expose ANSI output. No additional application environment variables or database schema are required for this logging contract.

### Schema And Safety

`internal/config/logging.go`, `logging_fields.go`, and `logging_errors.go` define the output boundary. Every record has `ts`, `level`, `service`, `log_type`, `component`, `event`, `msg`, `log_schema_version`, `instance_id`, and `record_kind`. Schema version is `1`, service is `oswald-ai`, and log type is `server` or `agent`. The root logger generates an instance ID shared by its scoped children. `record_kind` defaults to `event`; callers override it with `measurement` for individual operations, `summary` for aggregate outcomes, or `snapshot` for point-in-time gauges.

- Use `log.Server(component)` for transport, startup, storage, broker, registry, and provider infrastructure. Use `log.Agent(component, requestID, canonicalUserID, gateway, model)` for request-scoped agent behavior: five string arguments, with no session argument. Request-scoped infrastructure also carries `request_id`; use `requestctx.LogFields` for available canonical/server-generated correlation.
- Events, components, and messages must be fixed developer-owned text. Use stable dotted event names and `config.F` with literal field keys. String keys require review in `stringLogFields`; the source must also allowlist or validate the actual values, not merely their keys. A syntactically valid label can still be private content. The output string filter is not a secret detector.
- Reviewed string labels are bounded to 256 UTF-8 bytes; invalid or oversized generic labels become `redacted`. Static messages are bounded to 1,024 bytes. Records are limited to 16 KiB; supported scalar arrays/slices retain at most 16 items. Safe numeric/bool metrics remain extensible. Named and unnamed scalar primitives are read without invoking custom string or JSON methods. Unknown string keys and private keys are omitted; unsupported objects, nonfinite numbers, or invalid/oversized payloads produce `logger.marshal_failed` with safe available correlation instead of serializing arbitrary objects.
- `config.ErrorField` emits only a fixed `error_code`, never raw error text. Typed SQLite numeric driver codes select storage classifications without logging SQLite messages. Do not restore `RawErrorField` or raw-error fields. `SafeErrorText` is for user responses only, not log content; unknown errors intentionally lose their details in logs.
- Safety applies equally at INFO and DEBUG. Never log prompts, responses, reasoning, tool arguments/results, URLs, external identities, phone numbers, email addresses, raw session/chat keys, image/base64 bytes, credentials, bootstrap codes, or duplicate fingerprints. Canonical user IDs and gateway names are allowed. Use reviewed operational labels, counts, sizes, durations, and reason codes instead of private content.
- IDs end in `_id`, counts in `_count`, durations in `_ms`, text sizes in `_chars`, and booleans begin with `is_`. Preserve existing units and historical keys when renaming Go counters. Keep numeric fields numeric in JSON. `status` is `ok`, `error`, `rejected`, `retry`, or `degraded`; `outcome` supplies additional meaning, such as `canceled`. Intentional cancellation is not itself an operational failure.

### Measurement Boundaries

`internal/llm/telemetry.go` owns one INFO `provider.gateway.chat.complete` or `provider.gateway.embed.complete` measurement per `Chat`/`Embed` invocation, including error and cancellation returns. These provider records are the authoritative observed token meter across foreground rounds, retries, formation, compaction, and indexing. Their `operation` values are `chat` and `embedding`, respectively. A call is not necessarily a submission: `is_submitted` is true only when a submission attempt is made, not during pre-submission validation/cancellation. Async status polls are not extra model submissions.

- `is_usage_reported` means at least one numeric usage field was reported, not that all usage is known. `is_usage_complete` requires success and available nonnegative prompt/total counts, plus completion counts for chat. `is_usage_invalid` marks observed negative usage. Only reported nonnegative token fields are logged; missing fields are not invented as zero or calculated from other fields.
- Cancellation/error can leave observed usage partial or unknown. A later invalid negative report does not erase a previously observed valid count. `internal/shared/requestctx/telemetry.go` collects only reported valid nonnegative counts, separating chat and embedding meters. A zero aggregate without its reported/complete flags does not prove zero remote work. Missing remote usage and collector loss prevent claims of complete billing or exactly-once ingestion.
- `duration_ms` is invocation wall time, including provider wait, network, and async polling, not raw decode time. `effective_output_tps` is reported completion tokens divided by that duration. `time_to_first_output_ms` is present only when streaming thinking/content is observable; it is not an async estimate or a first-tool-call timestamp.
- Provider per-call tokens, gateway `request_*` aggregates, and broker `execution_*` aggregates are different views of overlapping work. Never add all three levels together. Use provider records for observed usage totals, gateway summaries for addressed-request delivery, and execution summaries for actual processor completion.

`internal/gateway/runtime/executor.go` emits one INFO `gateway.request.received` after authentication and access checks admit a prompt or command, and one INFO `gateway.request.complete` per addressed runtime operation. Ignored messages do not become these request events. Pre-runtime transport/authentication rejections are separate gateway diagnostics, not admitted prompts. A runtime fallback or rejection can have a completion with `is_admitted=false` and no received record.

`request_kind` is `prompt`, `command`, or `fallback`. `prompt_type` is `text`, `text_image`, `image`, `unsupported`, or `empty`, classified from inbound content before generated reply/context enrichment. Completion includes `duration_ms`, `queue_wait_ms`, `agent_duration_ms`, `delivery_duration_ms`, separate `execution_status`, `delivery_status`, `persistence_status`, and request tool/model/embedding counters with usage flags. Delivery timing in `internal/gateway/runtime/telemetry.go` covers response sends, not indicators or durable post-delivery bookkeeping.

Stop can return immediately with broker result `ExecutionComplete=false`, before the current provider call reports usage. The gateway summary then has `is_execution_complete=false`, incomplete usage flags, and `persistence_status=unknown`; its counters can omit late work. `internal/broker/telemetry.go` emits `broker.request.execution.complete` on actual `Process` return, with eventual `execution_*` totals even after gateway completion. The execution snapshot is separate from the response, retaining counters when completion has an error and a nil response. Do not delay cancellation or add a goroutine just to wait for telemetry. `is_execution_complete` certifies processor return, not complete remote usage or delivery.

`internal/agent/agent.go` emits `agent.response.complete` for generation outcome and `agent.tool.complete` for each actual handler execution, with tool name/scope, operation correlation, duration, status/outcome, and bounded reason code. `agent.tool.blocked` records governance/authorization blocking separately; it is not an execution. Provider-specific tool diagnostics do not count as another tool execution. Request error rates come from terminal `gateway.request.complete` status, not the number of ERROR logs: `gateway.request.failed` is a separate diagnostic for the same failed operation.

`agent.tool.transcript.searched` is one INFO measurement per transcript-handler invocation, including empty, rejected, failed, and canceled searches. It reports `is_group`, returned count, duration, status/outcome, and available request correlation without chat IDs, query text, participant lists, or transcript content. Count actual tool executions using `agent.tool.complete`, not both events.

### Background And Health

Workload values are `foreground`, `formation`, `compaction`, `document_extraction`, `indexing`, `maintenance`, and `system`. `memory_formation` is a `job_kind`, not a workload; document extraction has its own job table and no model permit. Formation and compaction services use fresh attempt operation IDs, workload, job ID/kind, canonical ownership, and available persisted source-request/turn correlation. Workers do not fabricate gateway external identities; gateway and parent-operation information unavailable in persisted jobs is not reconstructed from private session keys. Foreground compaction overrides workload while preserving the request's usage collector and parent operation.

`internal/memory/formation/service.go` logs formation completion only after durable completion succeeds, including local saves, empty extraction, and artifact replay. Retry APIs return the successfully persisted state; `internal/compaction/service.go` uses stored submission/artifact state for retry/dead reporting rather than attempt-count guesses. Worker cancellation/preemption/refund outcomes are INFO; independent storage failures remain warnings.

`broker.health` is an INFO snapshot at broker lifecycle boundaries and every 30 seconds, with worker, queued, active, outstanding, capacity, oldest-queued-age, accepting, and background-active fields. `internal/memory/indexing/service.go` uses its existing 30-second indexing schedule for `memory.jobs.health`, `index.availability`, and `app.health`. A busy serialized indexing cycle can delay these snapshots. Snapshot reads share a scoped five-second timeout; failed reads emit diagnostic WARNs and omit unavailable data rather than claim zero backlogs.

Job gauges include queued/active/retry/dead/succeeded/skipped counts and `expired_lease_count`. `oldest_ready_age_ms` measures queued/retry time past `available_at`, not job creation age. Index availability is INFO when available and WARN when degraded. Failed rebuilds are WARN with no invented coverage/counts; successful rebuilds report validated live counts. Process gauges include goroutines, heap bytes, GC count, and `is_last_maintenance_known`. Last successful maintenance is process-local and unknown after restart until a sweep succeeds; `last_maintenance_age_ms` is omitted while unknown.

`internal/database/maintenance/service.go` reports every sweep at INFO or WARN, including unchanged sweeps: immediately at worker start, then hourly under the default policy. Successful ordinary sweeps emit INFO `maintenance.sweep.complete`; live-index degradation and failed phases emit WARN, and cancellation emits INFO. Counts include only committed mutations, retaining earlier committed phase counts if a later transaction rolls back. `rows_changed` counts committed operations, not distinct rows. Do not synthesize a successful zero-count summary after failure. `internal/database/migrations.go` logs migration application at INFO only after commit and foreign-key restoration, with applied count and prior/target release; unchanged opens are silent. `internal/startup/app.go` reports build metadata, initialization/cleanup boundaries, and `app.shutdown.complete` after acquired-resource cleanup, without implying gateway readiness or graceful listener shutdown.

### Contributor Rules

- Add safe INFO-level monitoring alongside every new operational path, even if nobody queries it today. Use bounded summaries and periodic gauges rather than payloads or hot-loop noise. WARN/ERROR diagnostics remain visible at the INFO threshold; DEBUG is supplemental only.
- Assign one owner to each terminal measurement/summary and emit it exactly once on all applicable success, failure, cancellation, rejection, empty-result, and replay paths. Distinguish attempts, retries, committed mutations, delivery outcomes, and final execution outcomes. Do not duplicate error diagnostics across layers or count diagnostics as additional operations.
- Propagate available request/operation/parent/job correlation and canonical ownership; never manufacture unavailable identity metadata. Record unknown/incomplete states explicitly. Preserve immediate cancellation, transaction/lease fencing, and committed-only counts rather than changing behavior to improve a metric.
- Test emission counts, levels, correlation, field types, missing/partial/negative usage, nil-response errors, late cancellation, rollback, and private-data canaries at INFO and DEBUG when changing those paths. `internal/config/logging_contract_test.go` is a limited AST guard for recognized logger/config-field conventions, not a general analyzer or proof of safety. Keep runtime logging boundary tests and source-value review.
- Keep Loki index labels low-cardinality: service, level, log type, component, event, optionally gateway. Request/operation/instance/user/job IDs, tool names, model names, and numeric measurements remain JSON fields, not high-cardinality ingestion labels. Query-time extraction/grouping does not require promoting them to index labels. Preserve the schema and document changed event semantics here.

### LogQL Recipes

These examples assume the collector promotes `service` to a Loki label, so `{service="oswald-ai"}` selects stderr JSON records. Adjust that selector to the environment. Other fields are extracted at query time; use canonical `user_id`, never external identity. Filter `__error__=""` after JSON parsing and again after numeric `unwrap` to exclude parse/conversion errors. Windows and grouping are examples, not dashboards or ingestion guarantees.

1. Admitted prompt count over one hour, by gateway, canonical user, and inbound prompt type (excludes commands):

```logql
sum by (gateway, user_id, prompt_type) (count_over_time({service="oswald-ai"} | json | __error__="" | event="gateway.request.received" | request_kind="prompt" | is_admitted="true" [1h]))
```

2. Admitted addressed-request p95 end-to-end latency in milliseconds:

```logql
quantile_over_time(0.95, {service="oswald-ai"} | json | __error__="" | event="gateway.request.complete" | is_admitted="true" | unwrap duration_ms | __error__="" [5m]) by (gateway)
```

3. Observed chat total tokens, including reported usage from failed/canceled calls; calls reporting only prompt/completion counts cannot contribute a total:

```logql
sum by (user_id, gateway, model, workload) (sum_over_time({service="oswald-ai"} | json | __error__="" | event="provider.gateway.chat.complete" | operation="chat" | is_usage_reported="true" | total_tokens!="" | unwrap total_tokens | __error__="" [1h]))
```

4. Mean per-call effective output TPS for chat calls with complete usage (not fleet decode throughput):

```logql
avg_over_time({service="oswald-ai"} | json | __error__="" | event="provider.gateway.chat.complete" | operation="chat" | is_usage_complete="true" | effective_output_tps!="" | unwrap effective_output_tps | __error__="" [5m]) by (model)
```

5. Actual tool executions by name, excluding blocked calls:

```logql
sum by (tool_name) (count_over_time({service="oswald-ai"} | json | __error__="" | event="agent.tool.complete" [1h]))
```

6. Tool execution failure fraction by name (canceled/degraded outcomes are not `status=error`):

```logql
sum by (tool_name) (rate({service="oswald-ai"} | json | __error__="" | event="agent.tool.complete" | status="error" [5m]))
/
sum by (tool_name) (rate({service="oswald-ai"} | json | __error__="" | event="agent.tool.complete" [5m]))
```

7. Admitted request failure fraction by gateway, based on terminal summaries rather than ERROR-line counts:

```logql
sum by (gateway) (rate({service="oswald-ai"} | json | __error__="" | event="gateway.request.complete" | is_admitted="true" | status="error" [5m]))
/
sum by (gateway) (rate({service="oswald-ai"} | json | __error__="" | event="gateway.request.complete" | is_admitted="true" [5m]))
```

8. Latest queued-job gauge per kind and instance, not the sum of historical snapshots:

```logql
last_over_time({service="oswald-ai"} | json event="event", job_kind="job_kind", instance_id="instance_id", queued_count="queued_count" | __error__="" | event="memory.jobs.health" | unwrap queued_count | __error__="" [5m]) by (job_kind, instance_id)
```

An absent rate series is not necessarily an explicit zero; a missing snapshot may be delayed or failed. The gauge can be stale within its lookback window. Do not sum database-wide gauges from multiple instances sharing a database. For investigation, filter parsed `request_id`/`operation_id` or `job_id` on log queries rather than adding index labels. None of these queries can recover unreported provider usage, lost log records, or deduplicate collector re-ingestion automatically.

## Extension Checklist

### Tools

1. Add the stable builtin name in `internal/tools/names/names.go` and its schema in `data/tools/`; extend the exact schema/name contract test. Private model tools are not builtin catalog entries.
2. Implement the handler under its builtin domain; put shared persistence in the owning domain package. Require authenticated principals for tenant-sensitive work and derive ownership from context, not model arguments.
3. Register explicit governance, argument normalization, and durable-history policy in `internal/tools/builtin/register.go`. Update stream-status rendering if needed without exposing sensitive arguments/results.
4. Cover enablement, validation, permissions, duplicate/failure behavior, cancellation, bounded output, and advertised schema. Update the inventory here and configuration examples only if configuration changes.

### Commands And Gateways

1. Commands belong under `internal/commands` adapters and register through builtin composition. `AdminOnly` is metadata: install middleware or enforce authorization explicitly. Sensitive fence resolvers must authorize themselves because resolution precedes middleware execution.
2. Use broker fences for canonical-user mutations and test them through delivery/invalidation. Out-of-band handlers cannot implement `FenceTargetResolver`; `HandlerFunc` implements that interface, so `/stop`-style commands need a dedicated handler type.
3. New gateways implement `gateway.Service`, normalize inbound requests, resolve authenticated principals, and provide `runtime.Responder`. Add assurance validity tests and wire construction only in `gateway/bootstrap.go`.
4. Verify group routing, reply handling, cancellation, delivery acknowledgement, attachments, and streaming. Attachment support is not yet a generic gateway capability contract; update tool visibility deliberately for a new text-only gateway.

### Persistence And Policy

1. Add exactly one new semantically named SQL migration for a schema release. Never modify released SQL or add a pre-v4 importer implicitly.
2. Preserve tenant/source/delivery/lease checks, foreign keys, JSON references, non-reusable IDs/high-water, and atomic outbox writes. Add fresh, supported-prefix, checksum-rejection, rollback, foreign-key, concurrent-open, and reopen coverage.
3. Version persisted artifact changes explicitly and retain decoders needed by existing v4 data. Do not rename JSON/schema/tool/log contracts as a side effect of Go cleanup.
4. Keep profile compilation deterministic, make current and retained legacy policy distinctions explicit, and test merge/reset/deletion/replay paths with any memory change.
5. Soul changes are operator filesystem edits to `data/memory/soul/soul.md`, applied on the next request; no model tool may mutate that policy.
